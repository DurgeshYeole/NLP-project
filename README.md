Author Features Prediction 
Description-
Classification is probably the most popular task that you would deal with in real life. Text in the form of blogs, posts, articles, etc. is written every second. It is a challenge to predict the information about the writer without knowing about him/her.  
 
We are going to create a classifier that predicts multiple features of the author of a given text. We have designed it as a Multilabel classification problem. 
Dataset 
Blog Authorship Corpus Over 600,000 posts from more than 19 thousand bloggers 
 
The Blog Authorship Corpus consists of the collected posts of 19,320 bloggers gathered from blogger.com in August 2004. The corpus incorporates a total of 681,288 posts and over 140 million words - or approximately 35 posts and 7250 words per person. 
 
Each blog is presented as a separate file, the name of which indicates a blogger id# and the bloggerâ€™s selfprovided gender, age, industry, and astrological sign. (All are labelled for gender and age but for many, industry and/or sign is marked as unknown.)
